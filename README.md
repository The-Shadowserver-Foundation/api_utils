Sample programs to access the API

Here are two programs, one in Python and one in Perl to help with the execution and accessing the data through the APIâ€™s.

For either of these programs to function, they expect a file called ~/.shadowserver.api to exist and to contain your API key and secret. As an example:

```
[api]
key = <<API-KEY>>
secret = <<SECRET>>
uri = https://transform.shadowserver.org/api2/
```

If an error like this occurs, it means that the query is going through a lot of data and the timeout in the program should be increased:

```
freed0@pit:~$ ./call-api.py reports/query '{"report":"united-states", "date":"2020-10-27", "query":{"city":"ashburn"}, "limit":3}' pretty
API Exception: The read operation timed out
```
