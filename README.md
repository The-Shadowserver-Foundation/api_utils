# api_utils
Sample programs to access the API

## call-api

Here are two programs, one in Python and one in Perl to help with the execution and accessing the data through the APIâ€™s.

For either of these programs to function, they expect a file called ~/.shadowserver.api to exist and to contain your API key and secret. As an example:

```
[api]
key = <<API-KEY>>
secret = <<SECRET>>
uri = https://transform.shadowserver.org/api2/
```

If an error like this occurs, it means that the query is going through a lot of data and the timeout in the program should be increased:

```
$ ./call-api.py reports/query '{"report":"united-states", "date":"2020-10-27", "query":{"city":"ashburn"}, "limit":3}' pretty
API Exception: The read operation timed out
```

Additional details can be found at https://github.com/The-Shadowserver-Foundation/api_utils/wiki.

## report-manager

This program utilizes the reports API to maintain a file system tree with the option to send notifications when new reports are downloaded for processing.

Queue options:

 - Apache Kafka
 - Redis
 - STOMP (ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ)

Usage: `report-manager.py /path/to/config.ini [ days ]`

The optional 'days' argument is the number of previous days to download reports for.  The default is 2.

Sample configuration file:

~~~
[reports]
directory = /var/tmp/reports
min_disk_free = 512
notifier = none
url_prefix = http://myserver/reports/

[stomp]
server = 127.0.0.1
port = 61613
user = guest
password = guest
queue = /queue/mytest

[redis]
server = 127.0.0.1
port = 6379
;password = guest
queue = mytest

[kafka]
server = 127.0.0.1
port = 9092
queue = mytest
~~~

The [reports] section is required and must contain the 'directory' key.

Settings:

 - directory     : top level directory to store reports in
 - min_disk_free : minimum disk free in MB to attempt download (default 512)
 - notifier      : specify a notification queue type [none, stomp, redis, or kafka]
 - url_prefix    : URL prefix replacement for the top level directory for notification messages
 - reports       : optional list of mailing list names you want to filter by
 - type          : optional report type to filter by

If a 'notifier' is configured in the [reports] section, an additional section with a matching
name is required.

Settings:

 - server       : server IP address or host name
 - port         : server port
 - queue        : queue identifier
 - user         : user name (if required)
 - password     : password (if required)


The notification entry is a JSON object that contains a timestamp, report date, report type, and uri:

```
{
   "timestamp" : "2022-09-01 11:32:45",
   "report_date" : "2022-08-31",
   "report_type" : "scan_stun",
   "uri" : "http://myserver/reports/2022/08/31/2022-08-31-scan_stun_example_com-asn.csv"
}
```

Example crontab to check for new downloads once per hour:

    15 * * * * /opt/shadowserver/report-manager.py /opt/shadowserver/reports.ini
